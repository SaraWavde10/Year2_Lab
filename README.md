# Galactic Hydrogen and Rotation Curve Analysis
This project investigates the 21-cm emission line of neutral hydrogen in the Milky Way, using observational data from Cygnus A, Virgo A, and multiple galactic longitudes. The aim was to estimate telescope resolution, fit emission line profiles, and use velocity corrections to construct a galactic rotation curve.
